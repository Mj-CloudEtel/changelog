Howdy partners,

With Meltdown and Spectre just behind us here comes another round of
security advisories and assorted changes.

Three mentionable changes are included: We are switching back to
single-source NAT on the primary IP instead of using all additional
VIPs on the interface.  The hardware-assisted VLAN capability check
was removed from the system enabling e.g. XEN users to create VLANs.
And the multi-WAN traffic shaping experience has been corrected for
non-default interfaces within the scope of shared forwarding.

Expected is an image release based on this version some time within
the next week for completeness.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: reverse reload order for gateway switching on OpenVPN
